My name is Sean O'Dell. My last name is actually evolved from odell which is the english version. During the time of railroad construction across the North American continent the Irish were a large majority of the work force. My great great grandparents changed their name to be more friendly with the Irish at the time and added the capitol letters with an apostrophe. Even given that history my DNA is 54% Scandinavian. My grandmothers parents were from Norway. My grandfather was English/Irish.
 I am married and we have two kids whom are 9 and 5 years old. 
 I have a Bachelor of Science in Communications and Electrical Engineering Technology from ITT Technical Institute, Graduated 2009.
 I also just completed another Bachelor of Science in IT Software Emphasis from WGU Washington online. Graduated 2018.
